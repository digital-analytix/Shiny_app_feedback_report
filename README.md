# Shiny_app_feedback_report
Creating a shiny app for manager's to view their team's 360 survey results

This is a shiny app that I created on the 26th March 18.

The motivation for this project was two fold:

- I wanted too learn how to amke an app in shiny
- I was keen to show my clients the power of shiny and how we could embed this into the workflow of SMEs
  to improve the utilisation of human capital tools.
  
For those that want to see the app, pls click the following links:
  
- appearance 1: https://sidmehtashinyapps.shinyapps.io/feedback_report_22feb18/
- appearance 2: https://sidmehtashinyapps.shinyapps.io/flatly/
- appearance 3: https://sidmehtashinyapps.shinyapps.io/journal/

The three versions have the same layout and content, but different appearance.

The code for the shiny apps is embedded in the following link:
