# Shiny_app_feedback_report
"A shiny app for manager's to view their team's 360 survey results"

This is a shiny app that I created on the 26th March 18.

The motivation for this project was two fold:

- I wanted too learn how build a shiny app
- I was keen to show my clients the power of shiny and how we could embed this into the workflow of SMEs
  to improve the utilisation of human capital tools.
  
For those that want to see the app, pls click the following links:
  
- appearance 1: https://sidmehtashinyapps.shinyapps.io/feedback_report_22feb18/
- appearance 2: https://sidmehtashinyapps.shinyapps.io/flatly/
- appearance 3: https://sidmehtashinyapps.shinyapps.io/journal/

The three versions have the same layout and content, but different appearance.

The code for the shiny apps is embedded in the following link: Shiny_app_feedback_report/Mgr_Feedback_report_22Feb18/
You will notice a folder for each of the three versions.

In order to build this app, I used the following workflow:
1) Envisioned the types data visuals that need to be built for the narrative. Built the approriate ggplots. R code available in this link - Shiny_app_feedback_report - refer to files called "Data_Viz..".
2) Checked out the shiny website to see the various showcase apps to draw isnpiration. 
   https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-user-showcase/
3) Then I looked at the gallery to imagine the best layout for my envisioned product. http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/
4) Then I picked up relevant code snippets to build the app. This was more about lifting from my R code and dropping it into the code sections of the selected shiny layout.

The above four steps eventually got me the first app.

Now I had to deploy the app for others to view. The following link helped me immensely. https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html

But I landed into operational challenges and the following links came to my rescue:

R Studio has brilliant material for self-learning and I used the following link heavily to build this app: http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/

My hope is that some of the detail I've provided will be helpful for a first time shiny aspirant.
